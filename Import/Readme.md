Import is an important part of moving this data to our REST API servers.

Right now the code is unfinished, need a lot of work.
It wouldn't really correlate with our main code structure.
maybe later we'll move it away. right now i want to make it work again in short amount of time.

one of the problems - old code using underscore library. so maybe later it'll be challenging to clean up all this stuff.
