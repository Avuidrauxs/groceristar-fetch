#### Unprocessed 'junk' - things that we should keep here.

Tasks:
- [ ] [Search Form static data](https://github.com/GroceriStar/static-data/issues/14)
- [ ] [ChickenKyiv Free Menu Release import data](https://github.com/GroceriStar/static-data/issues/10)
---

 - Proposal: add to each `get` method an attribute, related to debug.
I assume we'll need to have one `get` method, with cases, where we return a different data.
And when we pass a debug flag into our method - we'll get console.log with result, before returning it.

 - Proposal: have a one common place for common methods, that we're using quite often. Example: we need departments at CK and at GS. we need recipes at CK and S. We need menus at CK and MC

- Proposal: random stuff use lodash functions...

- Proposal: use module resolver.... with a new babel 7 core

- Proposal: use lodash methods for returninh random elements

- Proposal: does staticFiles.test works only at groceristar case? if no, why it's at projects folder?

@TODO use different flags for one command in order to call different imports
